Benchmarking of various frameworks used in interfacing rust with node.js. Many of the competing solutions arent clear on what approach is being used (FFI, N-API, WASM), which is a primary factor in the per-call performance overhead.

This project provides a minimal implementation of a function in each framework to benchmark these overheads so we can compare their peroformance. Result
